A simple program for a meal delivery service that calculates the total cost
of a user’s meal order based on their selected meal plan and any additional items they
choose.

•Create four variables to store: the user’s selected meal plan (selectedPlan), additional
items (additionalItems), whether the order is for takeaway (isTakeaway) and the total
order cost (totalCost).
• Assign a default value to selectedPlan representing the user's chosen meal plan as
follows:
- 'S' for Standard
- 'V' for Vegetarian
- 'F' for Family
• Assign a default value to additionalItems representing the number of additional items
the user selects.
• Set the value of isTakeaway to 'y' if the customer is ordering takeaway or 'n' if they are
not.
• Calculate the total order cost based on the following rules:
- standard plan: £7.99 per meal
- vegetarian plan: £6.99 per meal
- family plan: £29.99 for a family-sized meal
- additional items: £1.99 each per meal
- if the order is takeaway (isTakeaway is 'y'), apply a 5% discount to the total
cost.
• Display the selected meal plan, the number of additional items, whether the order is for
takeaway, and the total order cost to the user.
• You need to provide screenshots of your code and the different outcomes it can give.
• Your Word document should have appropriate headings to ensure that this task can
easily be identified alongside the rest of your work.
